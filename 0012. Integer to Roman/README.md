# Converting Integers to Roman Numerals in Python

## Introduction
In this document, we will explore a Python class designed to convert integers into their corresponding Roman numeral representations. This functionality is particularly useful in various applications, such as formatting numbers in a more classical style or for educational purposes. The provided code is efficient and straightforward, making it an excellent example of how to implement this conversion algorithmically.

## Key Concepts
Roman numerals are a numeral system originating from ancient Rome, utilizing combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). The primary challenge in converting integers to Roman numerals lies in the need to account for both standard values and subtractive combinations (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9). The code leverages a mapping of integer values to their Roman numeral counterparts, iterating through this mapping to construct the final numeral string.

## Code Structure
The code is encapsulated within a class named `Solution`, which contains a method `intToRoman`. This method accepts an integer as input and returns its Roman numeral representation as a string. The structure of the code is as follows:

- **Mapping Definition:** A list of tuples, `roman_map`, is defined, where each tuple contains an integer and its corresponding Roman numeral.
- **String Construction:** An empty string, `roman_str`, is initialized to build the final output.
- **Iteration and Subtraction:** A loop iterates through the `roman_map`, and for each value-symbol pair, a nested loop appends the symbol to `roman_str` while subtracting the value from `num` until `num` is less than the current value.
- **Return Statement:** Finally, the constructed Roman numeral string is returned.

## Code Examples
Here is the complete code for the integer to Roman numeral conversion:

```python
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        roman_map = [
            (1000, "M"),
            (900, "CM"),
            (500, "D"),
            (400, "CD"),
            (100, "C"),
            (90, "XC"),
            (50, "L"),
            (40, "XL"),
            (10, "X"),
            (9, "IX"),
            (5, "V"),
            (4, "IV"),
            (1, "I"),
        ]

        roman_str = ""
        for value, symbol in roman_map:
            while num >= value:
                roman_str += symbol
                num -= value
        return roman_str
```

## Conclusion
The provided Python code efficiently converts integers to Roman numerals using a systematic approach that leverages a mapping of values. This method is not only clear and concise but also adheres to best practices in programming. By understanding the underlying logic and structure, developers can easily adapt or extend this code for various applications, making it a valuable addition to any programmer's toolkit.
