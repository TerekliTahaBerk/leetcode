# Reverse Integer in Python

## Introduction
In this document, we will explore a Python class designed to reverse the digits of an integer. This functionality is particularly useful in various programming scenarios, such as data manipulation and algorithm challenges. The code adheres to the constraints of 32-bit signed integers, ensuring that the output remains within valid limits.

## Key Concepts
The primary concepts involved in this code include:

- **Integer Manipulation:** The ability to handle integers, including their signs and absolute values.
- **String Reversal:** Utilizing string operations to reverse the digits of the integer.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Ensuring that the reversed integer does not exceed the limits of a 32-bit signed integer.

## Code Structure
The code is structured within a class named `Solution`, which contains a single method called `reverse`. This method takes an integer as input and returns its reversed form, while also managing the sign and checking for overflow conditions.

### Breakdown of the Code:
- **Sign Handling:** The code first determines the sign of the integer.
- **Reversal Logic:** It converts the integer to its absolute value, transforms it into a string, reverses that string, and converts it back to an integer.
- **Overflow Check:** Before returning the result, it checks if the reversed integer exceeds the 32-bit signed integer range.

## Code Examples
Here is the provided code with comments explaining each step:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        # Determine the sign of the integer
        sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1

        # Reverse the absolute value of the integer
        reversed_x = int(str(abs(x))[::-1])

        # Check for 32-bit integer overflow
        if reversed_x > 2**31 - 1:
            return 0

        return sign * reversed_x
```

## Conclusion
The `reverse` method in the `Solution` class effectively reverses the digits of an integer while managing its sign and ensuring that the result remains within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer. This code serves as a practical example of integer manipulation and string operations in Python, making it a valuable addition to any programmer's toolkit. By understanding this code, developers can enhance their skills in handling numerical data and implementing algorithmic solutions.
