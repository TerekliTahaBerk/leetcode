## Understanding the Two Sum Problem in Python

### Introduction
The Two Sum problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that requires finding two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target. This problem is often encountered in coding interviews and is a fundamental exercise for understanding data structures and algorithms. In this document, we will dissect a Python implementation of the Two Sum problem, explaining its components and functionality in detail.

### Key Concepts
Before diving into the code, let's clarify some key concepts:

- List: A collection of items that can be of any data type. In this case, we are working with a list of integers.
- Target: The sum we want to achieve by adding two distinct numbers from the list.
- Complement: The value that, when added to a given number, equals the target. It is calculated as target - nums[i].

### Code Structure
The provided code defines a class named Solution with a method twoSum. This method takes two parameters: nums, which is a list of integers, and target, which is the integer sum we are trying to achieve. The method returns a list of two indices corresponding to the numbers that add up to the target.

Here’s a breakdown of the code structure:

- Class Definition: class Solution
- Method Definition: def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]
- Loop through the list: A for loop iterates through each index of the list.
- Calculate Complement: For each number, the complement is calculated.
- Check for Existence: The code checks if the complement exists in the list and ensures it is not the same index as the current number.
- Return Indices: If a valid pair is found, the indices are returned.

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in nums and nums.index(complement) != i:
                return [i, nums.index(complement)]
```

### _Explanation of the Code:_

- Imports: The code imports List from the typing module to specify the type of the input parameters.
- Loop: The for loop iterates through each index i of the nums list.
- Complement Calculation: The line complement = target - nums[i] computes the value needed to reach the target when added to nums[i].
- Existence Check: The condition if complement in nums and nums.index(complement) != i checks if the complement exists in the list and ensures that it is not the same element as nums[i].
- Return Statement: If the condition is satisfied, the method returns a list containing the indices of the two numbers.

### Conclusion
The Two Sum problem is a fundamental exercise in algorithm design and implementation. The provided Python code efficiently finds two indices of numbers in a list that sum up to a specified target. While
